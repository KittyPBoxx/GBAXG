# Acknowledgments 

# GBA / NDS

- **[Fleroviux](https://github.com/fleroviux)**: For producing the excellent NanoBoyAdvance GBA emulator, sharing countless reverse engineering research/test roms and for being a good friend. NBA was used to generate golden test vectors which were essential to the early bring up of the SkyEmu GBA core and without our back and forth collaboration SkyEmu would have never reached this level.  
- **Martin Korth (Nocash)**: For his reverse engineering and documentation work on the GBA and NDS published at [GBATEK](https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm). It was the single source of documentation for this HW that I referred to the most while developing SkyEmu. 
- **[Vicki Pfau (Endrift)](https://github.com/endrift)**: For producing the excellent GBA-suite test rom which was invaluable to replicating many of the edge cases in the GBA HW. 
- **[Zayd](https://github.com/GhostRain0), [LadyStarbreeze](https://github.com/LadyStarbreeze), [wheremyfoodat](https://github.com/wheremyfoodat), [DenSinH](https://github.com/DenSinH/), [destoer](https://github.com/destoer/), [jsmolka](github.com/jsmolka/), [TONC](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/)**: For producing test roms that were used at varying stages of the development of the emulator. 
- **[Cult of GBA (DinSinH + Fleroviux)](https://github.com/Cult-of-GBA/BIOS)**: For the open source replacement BIOS for the GBA that ships with SkyEmu

# Other
- **Near**: For the general encouragement, discussions, and blog posts I used while I was starting out in emulation. Rest in peace friend.
